## Installation
Clone the project. Type in the following commands into your terminal:

You should now be able to run your app through Insomnia or another similar app.

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
