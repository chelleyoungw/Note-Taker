## Description
When you open the Note Taker app you are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. When you click the link, you are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column. When you enter a new note title and text a "Save Note" button and "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page. When you click on "Save Note" the new note is saved and appears in the left-hand column and the text in the note title and text is cleared. When you click on an existing note in the left-hand column, the note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation. When you click on the "New Note" button in the navigation, you are shown empty fields to enter a new note title and text and the button dissapears. If you click the red trashcan icon next to a note in the left-hand column it will delete the note.
